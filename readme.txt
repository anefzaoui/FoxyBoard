== Description ==

The Foxy Board Firefox App Widget allows to easily add Firefox App details to blog-posts through a minimalistic and easy-to-use HTML widget.

To add the widget to your post use the following short-code templates:

For a single app:
`[firefox-app id="app-slug"]`
Example
`[firefox-app id="twitter"]`
`[firefox-app id="arabic-mozilla"]`

The short-code will be replaced with the Foxy Board Widget. You can add to the same blog-post as many widgets as you like.
